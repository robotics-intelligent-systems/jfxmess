# Multi-Energy System Simulator

This Mixed Integer Linear Programming Model (MILP) has been developed as part of an Ofgem SIF funded Alpha Phase project to design and build a 'Gas System of the Future', Digital Twin in collaboration with SGN, Esri, AWS and DNV. Antares Simulator is an open-source power system simulator. ThermoSysPro is a library providing model components in the disciplines of thermal hydraulics and instrumentation and control. A package for Modelica simulating Molten Salt Reactors. The ThermoCycle library is a library for dynamic modelling of thermal systems. preCICE is an open-source coupling library for partitioned multi-physics simulations, including, but not restricted to fluid-structure interaction and conjugate heat transfer simulations. The Metroscope Modeling Library contains modelica modules for industrial components such as pumps, turbines, heat exchangers, to build steady-state digital twins of industrial process. PowerGrids, a Modelica library for electro-mechanical modelling of power systems. DSNP (Dynamic Simulator for Nuclear Power-Plants) is a system of programs and data files used to simulate nuclear power plants or parts thereof. DDNRS-ERSN is an Open Nuclear Reactor Simulator and Reactor Core Analysis Tool based on the Version5 of the reactor physics codes DRAGON and DONJON developed at École Polytechnique de Montréal. ClaRa is a Modelica library for simulation of Clausius-Rankine (ClaRa) cycles in power plants. ModelcaGridData generate power grid dynamic simulation data automatically for machine learning applications using Python and Modelica models. MOOSE is an object-oriented C++ finite element framework for developing tightly coupled multiphysics solvers. Armi is an open-source nuclear reactor analysis automation framework that helps design teams increase efficiency and quality
