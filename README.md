# Nuclear Hydrogen Production System

DSNP (Dynamic Simulator for Nuclear Power-Plants) is a system of programs and data files used to simulate nuclear power plants or parts thereof. DDNRS-ERSN is an Open Nuclear Reactor Simulator and Reactor Core Analysis Tool based on the Version5 of the reactor physics codes DRAGON and DONJON developed at École Polytechnique de Montréal. Nuclear marine propulsion is propulsion of a ship or submarine with heat provided by a nuclear reactor. A floating nuclear power reactor ship is a power station that derives its energy from a nuclear reactor and is mounted on a floating structure such as an offshore platform, barge, or conventional ship; as long as it can provide electricity and process heat, any type of nuclear reactor can be used for hydrogen production. A "SMART" (intelligent small modular reactor), with a power of up to 300 MW(e), designed to be built in a factory and transported to its final location. OPEN100 is a project that aims to provide open-source blueprints for the construction of nuclear power plants. The SMArtInt Library is designed to integrate various artificial intelligence (AI) models seamlessly into Modelica-based simulation tools. MARCO is a prototype compiler for the Modelica language and is based on the LLVM / MLIR compiler technology. MOOSE is an object-oriented C++ finite element framework for developing tightly coupled multiphysics solvers. Armi is an open-source nuclear reactor analysis automation framework that helps design teams increase efficiency and quality. OSP libcosim is a C/C++ library for co-simulation. xdyn is a lightweight ship simulator modelling the dynamic behaviour of a ship at sea.
