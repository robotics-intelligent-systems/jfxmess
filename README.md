# Nuclear Hydrogen Production System

Modelica Library of Chemical processes. A Modelica library for thermal power generation system modelling. The Metroscope Modeling Library contains modelica modules for industrial components such as pumps, turbines, heat exchangers, to build steady-state digital twins of industrial process. This repository contains the code for PowerGrids, a Modelica library for electro-mechanical modelling of power systems. DSNP (Dynamic Simulator for Nuclear Power-Plants) is a system of programs and data files used to simulate nuclear power plants or parts thereof. DDNRS-ERSN is an Open Nuclear Reactor Simulator and Reactor Core Analysis Tool based on the Version5 of the reactor physics codes DRAGON and DONJON developed at École Polytechnique de Montréal. Nuclear marine propulsion is propulsion of a ship or submarine with heat provided by a nuclear reactor. A floating nuclear power reactor ship is a power station that derives its energy from a nuclear reactor and is mounted on a floating structure such as an offshore platform, barge, or conventional ship; as long as it can provide electricity and process heat, any type of nuclear reactor can be used for hydrogen production. A "SMART" (intelligent small modular reactor), with a power of up to 300 MW(e), designed to be built in a factory and transported to its final location. OPEN100 is a project that aims to provide open-source blueprints for the construction of nuclear power plants. ClaRa is a Modelica library for simulation of Clausius-Rankine (ClaRa) cycles in power plants. ModelcaGridData generate power grid dynamic simulation data automatically for machine learning applications using Python and Modelica models. MOOSE is an object-oriented C++ finite element framework for developing tightly coupled multiphysics solvers. Armi is an open-source nuclear reactor analysis automation framework that helps design teams increase efficiency and quality. Free library for modelling and simulation of waste water treatment plants.
